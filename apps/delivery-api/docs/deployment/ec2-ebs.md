# EC2 + EBS deployment readiness

This service starts with a single AWS EC2 host running the Node API and PostgreSQL on an EBS-backed volume. PostgreSQL should move to RDS when operational load, backup requirements, or availability requirements exceed a single-host profile.

## Runtime units

- API: `clever-delivery-server` Node 22 container
- Database: PostgreSQL 17 container backed by an EBS-mounted Docker volume path
- Public ingress: HTTPS reverse proxy or load balancer terminating TLS before the API
- Health checks: `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz`

## Required environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set at minimum:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://clever:<password>@postgres:5432/clever_delivery
POSTGRES_DB=clever_delivery
POSTGRES_USER=clever
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<strong-password>
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=<shopify-app-api-key>
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=<shopify-app-api-secret>
SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2026-04
SHOPIFY_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=base64:<32-byte-base64-key>
JWT_SECRET=<driver-api-secret-when-driver-api-exists>
```

Never commit real `.env` files, Shopify secrets, DB passwords, or token-encryption keys.

Additional runtime groups represented in `.env.example`:

- API process controls: `NODE_ENV`, `PORT`, and `LOG_LEVEL`.
- Compose/local bind controls: `API_PORT` and `POSTGRES_PORT`.
- Shopify app integration controls: `SHOPIFY_APP_URL` for CORS and app origin wiring,
  `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`, `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`, and `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION` for app auth,
  plus `SHOPIFY_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` for stored Admin API token ciphertext.
- Local-only Shopify shortcuts, if used, must stay outside production evidence:
  `SHOPIFY_SHOP_DOMAIN` and `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
- `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is reserved in the example env file; the current webhook
  HMAC verifier is wired from `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`.
- Driver API/proof-media controls are documented in the proof-media sections below;
  none of the S3, scanner, monitor, or cleanup evidence values should be pasted into
  public issues, PRs, logs, or screenshots.

## Local compose smoke

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill required secrets before enabling Shopify routes.
docker compose config
docker compose up --build
curl http://localhost:3000/healthz
curl http://localhost:3000/readyz
```

## EC2/EBS host outline

1. Create an EC2 instance with Docker Engine and Compose plugin installed.
2. Attach and mount a dedicated EBS volume for PostgreSQL data.
3. Keep the repo checkout and `.env` outside the PostgreSQL data mount.
4. Run `docker compose up -d --build` from the repo root.
5. Confirm health endpoints.
6. Configure reverse proxy/TLS and Shopify app webhook URL to point to the public API origin.

Example EBS mount target:

```text
/mnt/clever-delivery-postgres
```

For production, bind the `postgres-data` volume to the mounted EBS path using a host path or Docker volume driver configuration before first database initialization.

## Backup

Install PostgreSQL client tools on the host or run the scripts from a container that has `pg_dump` / `pg_restore`.

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://clever:<password>@localhost:5432/clever_delivery \
  BACKUP_DIR=/mnt/clever-delivery-backups \
  scripts/postgres-backup.sh
```

The script writes custom-format dumps named `clever_delivery_<UTC timestamp>.dump`.

## Restore

Restore only into an explicitly selected target database:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://clever:<password>@localhost:5432/clever_delivery \
  BACKUP_FILE=/mnt/clever-delivery-backups/clever_delivery_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ.dump \
  scripts/postgres-restore.sh
```

`pg_restore --clean --if-exists` can delete target database objects. Do not run restore against production until the target DB and backup file are verified.

## RDS migration path

1. Stop background sync/webhook processing or put the app into maintenance mode.
2. Take a final EBS PostgreSQL backup with `scripts/postgres-backup.sh`.
3. Restore into the RDS PostgreSQL instance.
4. Run Prisma validation/migrations against RDS.
5. Update `DATABASE_URL` to RDS and restart API containers.
6. Verify `/readyz`, Shopify auth/token exchange, webhook receive, and order-sync smoke.
7. Keep the EBS volume read-only until RDS cutover is accepted.

## Current gaps

- No real AWS resources are provisioned by this repo yet.
- No CI image publish workflow exists yet.
- No live DB migration has been run yet.
- Secrets management is still `.env`/host-managed; move to AWS SSM/Secrets Manager before production hardening.

## GitHub-based EC2 deployment

The MVP host can be deployed from GitHub Actions after the EC2 host has a checked-in deploy script and the host keeps runtime-only files outside Git:

- repository checkout: `/srv/clever-delivery-server`
- runtime secrets: `/srv/clever-delivery-server/.env` (not committed)
- TLS reverse proxy config: `/srv/clever-delivery-server/Caddyfile` (not committed; copy from `Caddyfile.example`)
- compose files: `docker-compose.yml` + `docker-compose.prod.yml`

Required GitHub repository secrets:

```text
EC2_HOST=3.39.216.177
EC2_USER=ubuntu
EC2_APP_DIR=/srv/clever-delivery-server
EC2_SSH_KEY=<private key for the EC2 key pair>
```

Deployment behavior:

1. GitHub Actions connects to the EC2 host over SSH.
2. `scripts/deploy-ec2.sh` initializes or updates a git checkout in `EC2_APP_DIR`.
3. The script preserves `.env` and `Caddyfile` as host-managed runtime files.
4. Docker Compose rebuilds the API image and restarts the API/PostgreSQL/Caddy stack.
5. Prisma applies the current schema with `prisma db push --skip-generate`.
6. The script verifies local `/healthz` and `/readyz` before completing.

The workflow runs automatically after changes merge to `dev`, and can also be run manually with `workflow_dispatch` for a selected ref.

### Proof-media S3-compatible storage

Production proof-media storage can be selected with `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_STORAGE_BACKEND=s3`. Required runtime secrets/config are:

- `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_S3_BUCKET`
- `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_S3_REGION`
- `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

Optional values are `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_S3_ENDPOINT`, `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE`, and `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_S3_SESSION_TOKEN` for S3-compatible providers, path-style endpoints, and temporary credentials. The backend signs PUT/DELETE requests and presigned GET read access with AWS Signature Version 4. Keep credentials in the host/container secret mechanism and record only sanitized bucket/IAM policy evidence in change-control issues.

A production release still needs private evidence for bucket ownership, IAM least-privilege policy, credential rotation/custody, signed URL smoke, malware scanner deployment, scanner alerting, and cleanup scheduler deployment.

### Proof-media HTTP scanner and scan monitor

Production scanner wiring can be selected with `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_SCANNER_BACKEND=http`. Required runtime config is `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_SCANNER_URL`; `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_SCANNER_BEARER_TOKEN` is optional but recommended for private scanner endpoints. The scanner receives sanitized proof bytes after JPEG EXIF stripping and before storage/metadata persistence, plus metadata headers for content type, sanitized SHA-256, and storage key. It must return `{"status":"clean"}` or `{"status":"rejected","reason":"private reason"}`.

Production scan-outcome monitoring can be selected with `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_SCAN_MONITOR_BACKEND=http`. Required runtime config is `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_SCAN_MONITOR_URL`; `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_SCAN_MONITOR_BEARER_TOKEN` is optional but recommended. The monitor receives sanitized JSON with media id, content type, storage key, sanitized SHA-256, scan timestamp, status, and optional private rejection reason. It does not receive proof file bytes.

A production release still needs private evidence for scanner endpoint deployment, endpoint auth/secret custody, clean and rejected scan smoke, alert routing, and incident response ownership.

### Proof-media cleanup scheduler evidence

Before filling private production evidence, capture the non-secret source/runtime
seed:

```bash
npm run driver:proof-media:evidence:seed
```

The seed reports commit/ref, proof-media config presence, and remaining evidence
gates without printing bucket names, endpoints, access keys, bearer tokens, proof
media, storage keys, database credentials, or completed evidence references. Use
it as the starting audit record in the private evidence store, then attach the
real bucket/IAM, signed URL, scanner, alerting, and scheduler evidence there.
Copy `docs/proof-media-production-evidence-manifest.template.md` into the
private evidence store, fill it there, and validate a local working copy before
approval:

```bash
npm run driver:proof-media:evidence:verify -- /path/to/private/proof-media-production-evidence-manifest-<date>-<sha>.md
```

The verifier checks for completeness and accidental sensitive/private artifacts;
it does not replace owner-controlled production evidence review.

Proof-media retention cleanup can be run manually or by a host scheduler:

```bash
npm run driver:proof-media:cleanup
```

The command removes expired proof-media bytes through the configured storage backend, marks deleted metadata, and records a sanitized `RetentionJobRun` row. `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_CLEANUP_EVIDENCE_REF` can point to a private scheduler/log/evidence location; do not store proof images, storage keys, customer data, coordinates, phone numbers, or raw logs in that value. A production release still needs deployed scheduler evidence showing the command runs on the selected environment.

For runtime request inspection without direct SSH, use the **Inspect EC2
Runtime** workflow. See `docs/deployment/log-inspection.md`.

### Self-hosted runner note

The MVP host currently uses a repository self-hosted runner named `clever-delivery-server-mvp` with labels:

```text
self-hosted, Linux, X64, clever-delivery-server, mvp-ec2
```

This avoids opening SSH to GitHub-hosted runner IP ranges. The workflow runs on the EC2 host itself and executes `scripts/deploy-ec2.sh` locally. The only required GitHub secret for this mode is:

```text
EC2_APP_DIR=/srv/clever-delivery-server
```

The older SSH secrets (`EC2_HOST`, `EC2_USER`, `EC2_SSH_KEY`) can remain for break-glass/manual recovery but are not used by the current workflow.
