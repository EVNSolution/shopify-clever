# Driver proof media production evidence manifest template

## Use and storage rules

Copy this template into the approved private production evidence store for each
proof-media hardening release candidate. Do not commit completed manifests,
bucket names, IAM policies, access keys, bearer tokens, scanner endpoints,
storage keys, proof files, raw logs, customer data, phone numbers, coordinates,
or private evidence screenshots to this repository.

Recommended private filename:

```text
proof-media-production-evidence-manifest-<yyyyMMdd>-<shortsha>.md
```

Before filling a copied manifest, seed the private evidence record from the
selected source revision:

```bash
npm run driver:proof-media:evidence:seed
```

After filling the external copy, validate a local working copy from this repo:

```bash
npm run driver:proof-media:evidence:verify -- /path/to/private/proof-media-production-evidence-manifest-<yyyyMMdd>-<shortsha>.md
```

The verifier should pass only after all `pending` placeholders are removed,
storage/signed-access, scanner/monitoring, cleanup scheduler, and private
evidence storage rows are approved or passing, and the production proof-media
decision is `approved`. The verifier does not prove the private evidence is
authentic; owner-controlled review remains required.
