# clever-delivery-server

Shopify companion delivery data server for CLEVER/Tomatono delivery operations.

Initial deployment target: AWS EC2 with EBS-backed PostgreSQL. Growth path: move PostgreSQL to RDS when scale or operational requirements justify it.

## Current repo state

This repository currently contains the basic Node.js/TypeScript API scaffold plus the first Prisma schema and shop-token storage foundation:

- Fastify app factory
- `/healthz` liveness endpoint
- `/readyz` readiness endpoint for the current HTTP scaffold
- TypeScript build, lint, typecheck, and Vitest test scripts
- Prisma/PostgreSQL schema for delivery operations
- AES-GCM helper for encrypting Shopify Admin API tokens before database storage
- Shop-token service/repository for encrypted per-shop token persistence
- Shopify session-token verifier, token-exchange client, API route, and env-driven runtime wiring
- Shopify HTTPS webhook HMAC verifier, receive route, and idempotent receipt-storage contract
- Shopify Admin GraphQL client plus order-sync query/mapper/service foundation
- Driver API bearer-token verifier, route+phone access lookup, consent persistence, assigned route read, proof-media upload metadata/storage/scan hook, and idempotent driver-event ingest route

Shopify webhook order processing, live Admin GraphQL sync validation, route optimization, driver login/session issuance APIs, stop-detail/action APIs, production object-store/retention/scanner deployment hardening for proof media, dedicated location access/usage logging, and live EC2/EBS deployment work are intentionally left for follow-up issue-linked branches.

## Local development

Recommended Node version: 22 LTS. The repo includes `.nvmrc` with `22`.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Health checks:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/healthz
curl http://localhost:3000/readyz
```

Validation:

```bash
npm run check:workspace
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run driver:proof-media:evidence:seed
npm run driver:proof-media:evidence:verify -- /path/to/private/proof-media-production-evidence-manifest-<date>-<sha>.md
npm run build
```

Docker/Compose runtime preparation:

```bash
docker compose config
docker compose up --build
```

See `docs/deployment/ec2-ebs.md` for EC2/EBS deployment, backup/restore, and RDS migration-path notes.

See `docs/api/README.md` for the API documentation storage strategy and `docs/api/openapi.yaml` for the Swagger/OpenAPI contract covering Shopify, admin, driver mobile, and health endpoints. The deployed Swagger UI is served at `https://clever-delivery.3-39-216-177.sslip.io/docs`, with raw OpenAPI YAML at `/docs/openapi.yaml`.

## Repository governance

- Contribution flow: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Security reporting and data-handling expectations: `SECURITY.md`
- Product scope and release constraints: `docs/project-brief.md`
- Agent workflow rules: `AGENTS.md`
- Repository hygiene: `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, `.editorconfig`, and `.gitattributes`
  keep local env files, proof-media runtime data, DB dumps, private evidence,
  completed proof-media evidence manifests, and generated outputs out of
  git/build contexts while normalizing source text to LF.

## Database schema

The repository now includes the first Prisma/PostgreSQL schema at `prisma/schema.prisma`.

The `Shop` model is prepared for automatic Shopify app/token connection flows:

- `shopDomain` uniquely identifies the Shopify shop.
- `adminAccessTokenCiphertext` stores the encrypted Admin API access token.
- `adminAccessTokenExpiresAt`, `adminRefreshTokenCiphertext`, and `adminRefreshTokenExpiresAt` reserve space for expiring offline-token refresh flows.
- `tokenScopes` records the granted Admin API scopes.

Local schema validation does not require a running PostgreSQL server:

```bash
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:validate
npm run prisma:format
```

Actual migration files and live PostgreSQL smoke validation are intentionally left for the follow-up DB/runtime branch.

## Shopify auth token exchange API readiness

Embedded Shopify apps can exchange App Bridge session tokens for Admin API access tokens. The first server-side route contract is now prepared for that flow:

```http
POST /shopify/auth/token-exchange
Authorization: Bearer <Shopify App Bridge session token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "shopDomain": "example.myshopify.com"
}
```

The route dependencies are injectable for tests. The production server registers the route when `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`, `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`, and `SHOPIFY_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` are configured. The route contract:

- rejects missing or invalid bearer session tokens;
- verifies Shopify JWT session-token signature and claims before accepting the request;
- exchanges the verified session token against Shopify's token-exchange endpoint;
- stores returned Admin API token metadata through the encrypted shop-token service;
- returns `{ tokenStored: true, shopDomain, tokenScopes }` without exposing token plaintext.

The storage foundation for the route includes:

- `loadShopifyTokenEncryptionKey()` reads `SHOPIFY_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
- `encryptSecret()` / `decryptSecret()` use AES-256-GCM with associated shop context.
- `ShopTokenService.storeAdminApiToken()` encrypts access/refresh tokens and writes only ciphertext through the repository.
- `ShopTokenService.getAdminAccessToken()` decrypts the stored Admin API token for future Shopify Admin GraphQL calls.

Shopify app credentials used by this runtime route are represented in `.env.example`:

- `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`
- `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`
- `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION`
- `SHOPIFY_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

Generate a local encryption key with:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Store it as:

```env
SHOPIFY_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=base64:<generated-value>
```

Do not commit real Shopify Admin API tokens or production encryption keys.

## Shopify webhook receive API readiness

The server can also prepare to receive HTTPS-delivered Shopify webhooks:

```http
POST /shopify/webhooks
X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256: <base64 HMAC>
X-Shopify-Topic: orders/create
X-Shopify-Shop-Domain: example.myshopify.com
X-Shopify-Webhook-Id: <uuid>
X-Shopify-Event-Id: <uuid>
X-Shopify-API-Version: 2026-04
Content-Type: application/json
```

The route is registered when `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` is configured. It:

- verifies `X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256` against the raw request body using the Shopify app secret;
- normalizes Shopify webhook headers case-insensitively through Fastify's header map;
- stores webhook receipt metadata with `rawBodySha256`, topic, shop domain, webhook ID, optional event ID, API version, and triggered timestamp;
- returns `202` for a newly recorded webhook and `200` for a duplicate receipt.

Webhook payload processing is not implemented yet. The current contract records receipt idempotently so later order-sync work can safely consume `orders/create`, `orders/updated`, and related topics.

## Shopify Admin GraphQL order sync foundation

The repository includes a credential-free foundation for pulling Shopify orders later:

- `ShopifyAdminGraphqlClient` posts to `https://{shop}/admin/api/{version}/graphql.json` with `X-Shopify-Access-Token`.
- `buildOrdersUpdatedSinceQuery()` creates a paginated `orders` query filtered by `updated_at`.
- `mapShopifyOrderNodeToDeliveryInputs()` maps Shopify order nodes into local `Order` and optional `DeliveryStop` write inputs.
- `ShopifyOrderSyncService.syncUpdatedOrdersPage()` fetches one page and persists each mapped order through an injectable repository.
- `PrismaOrderSyncRepository` upserts orders by `(shopId, shopifyOrderGid)` and delivery stops by `(shopId, orderId)`.

Live sync still requires an installed shop token in the `shops` table and a real Shopify store. By default Shopify order access is limited to recent orders unless the app has appropriate order scopes/access.

## Driver route access lookup API readiness

Driver clients should call this server, not Shopify Admin APIs directly. The first route+phone access contract is now prepared:

```http
POST /driver/route-access/lookup
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "routeContext": "<route-plan-id-uuid-or-shared-route-scope>",
  "phoneE164": "+14165550123"
}
```

The route is registered when `JWT_SECRET` is configured with the Driver API runtime. It validates that route context and E.164 phone are present before lookup, then checks the existing shop/route plan/assigned driver boundary. A matched active driver receives non-sensitive company guidance, `nextState: "consent_required"`, and a 900-second `driverAccess` bearer token for consent and assigned-route calls.

`routeContext` may be an exact `RoutePlan.id` UUID or a shared company/route scope stored at `RoutePlan.constraints.routeScope.routeScopeKey`. A shared scope with one active phone match resolves to the concrete route plan id. A shared scope with multiple active phone matches returns `MULTIPLE_MATCHES` with only company/route display context and a dispatch resolution hint; it does not include `driverAccess`, `driverContext`, `routeAccess`, `routePlanId`, stops, customer addresses, coordinates, order data, or proof data. Missing route, phone mismatch, inactive driver, and suspended driver responses also omit tokens, stop/customer/location details, and driver internals.

See `docs/api/driver-route-access.md` for the response contract and minimization notes.

## Driver consent API readiness

After a matched route+phone lookup returns `nextState: "consent_required"`, driver clients can persist required notice acceptance before requesting assigned route details:

```http
POST /driver/consents
Authorization: Bearer <server-issued driver JWT>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "routeContext": "<route-plan-id-uuid>",
  "recordedAt": "2026-05-12T05:50:00.000Z",
  "deviceContext": { "platform": "ios" },
  "appContext": { "appVersion": "0.1.0" },
  "consents": [
    { "type": "LOCATION_INFORMATION", "version": "location-v1", "accepted": true },
    { "type": "PERSONAL_INFORMATION", "version": "privacy-v1", "accepted": true }
  ]
}
```

The route is registered when `JWT_SECRET` is configured. It verifies the Driver API bearer token, records consent rows under the token driver/shop boundary, and returns only `CONSENT_RECORDED` evidence. It does not return route stops, customer addresses, coordinates, or order data.

See `docs/api/driver-consents.md` for the request/response contract, persistence model, and minimization notes.

## Driver assigned route API readiness

After consent is recorded, driver clients can read the route assigned to the bearer-token driver:

```http
GET /driver/assigned-route?routeContext=<route-plan-id-uuid>
Authorization: Bearer <server-issued driver JWT>
```

The route is registered when `JWT_SECRET` is configured. It verifies the Driver API bearer token, scopes the read by token shop and driver, optionally binds the read to `routeContext`, and returns either `ASSIGNED_ROUTE` with ordered stop context or `NO_ASSIGNED_ROUTE`. Unlike route access lookup and consent submission, this response can include stop addresses and coordinates after the driver boundary is verified.

See `docs/api/driver-assigned-route.md` for the response contract, data boundary, and compliance notes.


## Driver proof media API readiness

The native driver app can upload proof photos before sending stop-completion proof events:

```http
POST /driver/proof-media
Authorization: Bearer <server-issued driver JWT>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

Fields are `deliveryStopId`, `routePlanId`, `source` (`camera` or `library`), and image `file`. The route verifies the Driver API bearer token, validates multipart image payloads, checks that the route/stop belongs to the token driver/shop boundary, strips JPEG EXIF APP1 metadata before persistence, can post sanitized bytes to an optional HTTP scanner when `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_SCANNER_BACKEND=http`, can post sanitized scan outcome JSON to an optional HTTP monitor when `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_SCAN_MONITOR_BACKEND=http`, writes accepted bytes through the proof-media storage backend, and stores `DriverProofMedia` metadata with `storageKey`, sanitized `sizeBytes`, and sanitized `sha256`. Scanner rejections return `422 PROOF_MEDIA_REJECTED` without storing bytes or metadata.

Accepted media can be read only through the scoped access contract:

```http
GET /driver/proof-media/:mediaId/access
Authorization: Bearer <server-issued driver JWT>
```

The read-access route verifies the bearer token, scopes the media row to token shop + driver, requires `deletedAt: null`, and then asks the storage backend for a short-lived URL. `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_READ_ACCESS_TTL_SECONDS` defaults to 300 seconds. The default backend writes/removes local files under `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_STORAGE_DIR` (default `var/driver-proof-media`) but intentionally does not expose public file URLs. Set `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_STORAGE_BACKEND=s3` with `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_S3_BUCKET`, `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_S3_REGION`, `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to use S3-compatible object storage with SigV4 upload/delete signing and presigned read URLs; optional `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_S3_ENDPOINT`, `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE`, and `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_S3_SESSION_TOKEN` support compatible providers and temporary credentials. Cleanup jobs can use `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 180) and `deleteExpiredProofMedia()` to remove expired bytes through the configured backend and mark metadata with `deletedAt`; the cleanup command now persists a sanitized `RetentionJobRun` evidence row. Production bucket/IAM ownership approval, HTTP scanner deployment evidence, scanner monitoring endpoint evidence, deployed scheduler evidence, and private evidence storage remain hardening work.

Manual or cron-style cleanup command:

```bash
npm run driver:proof-media:evidence:seed
npm run driver:proof-media:cleanup
```

The evidence seed prints a non-secret source/runtime audit for the private
release evidence workspace. It omits bucket names, endpoints, access keys,
bearer tokens, storage keys, proof bytes, and completed evidence references.
After the private manifest is filled, validate a local working copy before
release approval:

```bash
npm run driver:proof-media:evidence:verify -- /path/to/private/proof-media-production-evidence-manifest-<date>-<sha>.md
```

The verifier rejects remaining `pending` placeholders, missing storage/signed
access, scanner/monitoring, cleanup scheduler, or private evidence approval
rows, a non-`approved` production proof-media decision, and common sensitive or
private artifact patterns. It does not replace private owner evidence review.

The cleanup command prints JSON with `scanned`, `deleted`, `missingFiles`, `uploadedBefore`, `deletedAt`, and `evidenceRecorded`. It wires a cleanup monitor that creates a `RetentionJobRun` row with sanitized counts, cutoff, run time, retention window, batch limit, and optional private `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_CLEANUP_EVIDENCE_REF`. The row intentionally excludes media ids, storage keys, proof bytes, customer data, and coordinates. Deployed scheduler evidence is still required before release.

See `docs/api/driver-proof-media.md` for the request/response contract and production storage/retention caveats.

## Driver API event ingest readiness

Driver clients should call this server, not Shopify Admin APIs directly. The first Driver API event route is prepared as:

```http
POST /driver/events
Authorization: Bearer <server-issued driver JWT>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "clientEventId": "mobile-event-1",
  "eventType": "LOCATION_UPDATED",
  "occurredAt": "2026-05-07T06:09:30.000Z",
  "routePlanId": "route-plan-id",
  "deliveryStopId": "stop-id",
  "latitude": 40.7128,
  "longitude": -74.006
}
```

The route is registered when `JWT_SECRET` is configured. It verifies HS256 bearer tokens with audience `clever-delivery-driver`, extracts driver/shop context, validates event payloads, and records driver events idempotently by `(driverId, clientEventId)`.

Driver login/session issuance, production proof-media bucket/IAM approval/scanner deployment/scanner alerting/scheduled deployment evidence, stop action status mutation semantics, and dedicated location access/usage ledgers are still follow-up work.
